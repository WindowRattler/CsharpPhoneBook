# CsharpPhoneBook
This is my first project using C#. It instantiates a Phone Book where one can store the name and number of a contact. 

I would like to implement a file-saving and reading method that could be accessed when prompted by selecting 'S', but didn't have the chance to make the method myself yet. This method would store/write the Contacts to the file and read them from their when prompted 'L' to list them. I ran into issues with Unauthorized Access Errors when attempting to make the method and decided to put it off for the time being.
